main
------------
variables
double weight
double height
double bmi
string category

algorithm
call getWeightHeight function pass the weight and height variables
call calcBMI function and store the return BMI in bmi, pass the weight and height variables
call classifyBMI function and pass the BMI var into it and store it in category

display the BMI value
display the category value



getWeightHeight
---------------
variables
double weight (passed to the function)
double height (passed to the function)

algorithm
prompt the user to enter weight in kilograms 
get the user's input and store in weight

prompt the user to enter height in meters
get the user's input and store in height


calcBMI
-------------
variables
double height (passed to function)
double weight (passed to function)
double bmi

algorithm
set BMI to weight / (height * height)
return the BMI value





classifyBMI
------------
variables
double bmi (function parameter)

algorithm
if BMI less than 18.5
    return "Underweight"
else if the bmi is greater than or equal to 18.5 and less than 25
    return "Normal weight"
else if the bmi is greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30
    return "Overweight"
else if BMI is greater than or equal to 30
    return "Obese"
